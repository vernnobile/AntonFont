description: <p>Anton is a reworking of a traditional \
  advertising sans serif typeface. The letter forms \
  have been digitised and then reshaped for use as a \
  webfont, the counters have been opened up a little \
  and the stems optimised for use as bold display \
  font in modern web browsers.</p>
